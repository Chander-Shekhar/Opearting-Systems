Implementing TAS, CAS and Bounded Waiting with CAS Mutual exclusion (ME) algorithms.
Comparing the algorithms on the basis of Average Time and Worst case Time taken by a process to enter the Critical Section(CS).

Input: The input to the programs will be a file, named inp-params.txt, consisting of the following parameters: n, k, λ1, λ2.
n: the number of threads, k: No. of times each thread enters the CS,
λ1, λ2: t1 and t2 are delay values that are exponentially distributed with an average of λ1, λ2
seconds.
The objective of these time delays is to simulate that these threads are performing some time consuming tasks.

Output: For each algorithm,

1.  A log of events demonstrating that mutual exclusion is satisfied.

Report: Explanation about design of the program and a comparision between the algorithms.
