Implementing Dining Philosopher's Problem using Conditional Statements.
Comparision of Average Time and Worst case Time taken by a thread to enter the Critical Section(CS).

Input: The input to the programs will be a file, named inp-params.txt, consisting of the following parameters: n, h, μCS, μRem.
n: the number of philosopher threads, h: No. of times each philosopher thread enters the CS(i.e. tries to eat),
μCS, μRem: t1 and t2 are delay values that are exponentially distributed with an average of μCS, μRem.
seconds.
The objective of these time delays is to simulate the process of thinking and eating for philosopher threads.

Output: For each algorithm,

1.  A log of events demonstrating that mutual exclusion is satisfied.
2. "Time.txt" with average and worst time taken for a thread to enter the CS.

Report: Explanation about design of the program and a comparision between the average and worst case time taken for different no.of threads.
