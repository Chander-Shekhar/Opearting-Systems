Implementing Rate-Monotonic Scheduling & Earliest Deadline First Scheduling in C++.
Comparing both the algorithms on the basis of Average Waiting Time and Deadlines missed.

Input: The input to the programs will be a file, named inp-params.txt, consisting of the
following parameters: n, the number of processes; followed by n lines consisting of Pi
(process id), t (processing time), p (period) and k (the number of times each process
repeats).
Note: For simplicity, you can assume that the period p and the deadline d for each process is
the same.

Output: For each algorithm, two files are generated.
1. A log of events named RM-Log.txt or EDF-Log.txt containing information about a process's execution.
2. Stats about the execution named RM-Stats.txt or EDF-Stats.txt.

Report: Explanation about design of the program and a comparision between both the algorithms.
